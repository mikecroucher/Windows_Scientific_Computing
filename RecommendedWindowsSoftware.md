# Recommended Software for Windows

This is a list of Windows software I recommend.  Most of it is free unless otherwise stated.

## Editors and IDEs

 - [MarkdownPad 2](http://markdownpad.com/) - MarkdownPad is a full-featured Markdown editor and previewer for Windows.  The free version is great, and the paid-for version is well worth the money.
 - [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) -  My favourite text editor for Windows.  Syntax highlghting for lots of languages, code folding, gracefully handles Linux/Windows line endings, extensive set of plug-ins, regularly updated.

## File Transfer and ssh clients

 - [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) - PuTTY is a free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Windows and Unix platforms.
 - [http://winscp.net/eng/index.php](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php) - Free SFTP, SCP and FTP client for Windows.
 - [http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) - A more advanced terminal  than PuTTY with a free 'personal edition' and a paid-for 'professional edition'.  I prefer this to PuTTY.

## PowerShell

 - [PowerShell Community Extensions](http://pscx.codeplex.com/) - PowerShell Community Extensions (PSCX) is aimed at providing a widely useful set of additional cmdlets, providers, aliases, filters, functions and scripts for Windows PowerShell that members of the community have expressed interest in. 

## Python

 - [Anaconda Python](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) - A single installer provides most of the Python modules you'll ever need for scientific work. The main package is free. There are add-ons that cost extra but these are free for academic use
