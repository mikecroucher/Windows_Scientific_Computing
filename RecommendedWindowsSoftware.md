# Recommended Software for Windows

This is a list of Windows software I recommend.  Most of it is free unless otherwise stated.

## Editors and IDEs

 - [MarkdownPad 2](http://markdownpad.com/) - MarkdownPad is a full-featured Markdown editor and previewer for Windows.  The free version is great, and the paid-for version is well worth the money.
 - [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) -  My favourite text editor for Windows.  Syntax highlghting for lots of languages, code folding, gracefully handles Linux/Windows line endings, extensive set of plug-ins, regularly updated.

## File Transfer and ssh clients

 - [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) - PuTTY is a free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Windows and Unix platforms.
 - [http://winscp.net/eng/index.php](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php) - Free SFTP, SCP and FTP client for Windows.
 - [http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) - A more advanced terminal  than PuTTY with a free 'personal edition' and a paid-for 'professional edition'.  I prefer this to PuTTY.

## Scripting - PowerShell

 - [PowerShell Community Extensions](http://pscx.codeplex.com/) - PowerShell Community Extensions (PSCX) is aimed at providing a widely useful set of additional cmdlets, providers, aliases, filters, functions and scripts for Windows PowerShell that members of the community have expressed interest in. 

## Languages
###Python

 - [Anaconda Python](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) - A single installer provides most of the Python modules you'll ever need for scientific work. The main package is free. There are add-ons that cost extra but these are free for academic use

###Julia

 - [Julia](http://julialang.org/) is a relatively new programming language for scientific computing. Potentially very fast.

###R

 - [R](http://www.r-project.org/) is commonly used for statistics and data analysis.
 - [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/) - A powerful IDE for R

###MATLAB

 - [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.co.uk/) is an expensive commercial product that is heavily used in Academia. Much of the in-depth functionality is hived-off into toolboxes (over 90 of them!) that all cost extra.
 - [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a free, open source of MATLAB. Many MATLAB programs will run unmodified in Octave. Support for the toolboxes is limited.
